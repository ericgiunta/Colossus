Description: Performs survival analysis using general non-linear models. Risk models can be the sum or product of terms. Each term is the product of exponential/linear functions of covariates. Additionally sub-terms can be defined as a sum of exponential, linear threshold, and step functions. Cox Proportional hazards <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_model>, Poisson <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression>, and Fine-Grey competing risks <https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/population-health-methods/competing-risk-analysis> regression are supported. This work was sponsored by NASA Grant 80NSSC19M0161 through a subcontract from the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP). The computing for this project was performed on the Beocat Research Cluster at Kansas State University, which is funded in part by NSF grants CNS-1006860, EPS-1006860, EPS-0919443, ACI-1440548, CHE-1726332, and NIH P20GM113109.
