Cox Proportional Hazards regression user identifies columns provide starting ending times, column gives event status. event status assumed binary covariate 1 intervals containing event. Colossus supports left censored data, right censored data, interval censored data. data interval censored default, left right censoring handled defining interval endpoints outside minimum maximum event times. Poisson regression user provides columns person-years per row number events. Poisson regression supports non-negative number events. user side, names columns containing time events need given. Lets assume dataframe organized follows: Cox Proportional Hazard need provide three column names: starting age, ending age, event happened interval. case “Starting_Age”, “Ending_Age”, “Cancer_Status”. example interval data, however may always case. Colossus designed allow user input “%trunc%” -place missing side interval. Colossus assumes means person missing endpoint outside available data range creates dummy column reference interval endpoint. code variables look like : Suppose instead interested Poisson regression, difference instead providing interval endpoints give column interval lengths. case need define new column, may case general. Suppose now working following table: just provide duration column event column, “Person_Years” “Cancer_Status”. code looks like following:","code":"df <- data.table(\"UserID\"=c(112, 114, 213, 214, 115, 116, 117),            \"Starting_Age\"=c(18,  20,  18,  19,  21,  20,  18),              \"Ending_Age\"=c(30,  45,  57,  47,  36,  60,  55),           \"Cancer_Status\"=c(0,   0,   1,   0,   1,   0,   0),                       \"a\"=c(0,   1,   1,   0,   1,   0,   1),                       \"b\"=c(1,   1.1, 2.1, 2,   0.1, 1,   0.2),                       \"c\"=c(10,  11,  10,  11,  12,  9,   11),                       \"d\"=c(0,   0,   0,   1,   1,   1,   1)) # For the interval case time1 <- \"Starting_Age\" time2 <- \"Ending_Age\" event <- \"Cancer_Status\"  # Supposing we had left truncated data the following would change time1 <- \"Starting_Age\" time2 <- \"%trunc%\"  # and with right truncated data the following is used time1 <- \"%trunc%\" time2 <- \"Ending_Age\"  #setting back to normal time1 <- \"Starting_Age\" time2 <- \"Ending_Age\" df$Person_Years <- df$Ending_Age -df$Starting_Age pyr <- \"Person_Years\" event <- \"Cancer_Status\""},{"path":"https://ericgiunta.github.io/Colossus/articles/starting-description.html","id":"control-and-verbosity","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Control and Verbosity","title":"Colossus_Description","text":"Colossus offers several options control input data used returned. can split two general categories. first category convergence parameters. cover number iterations used, limits parameter changes, stopping criteria. second category parameters used debugging additional information. common option verbosity. verbose mode prints time-steps intermediate values sum terms, sum risks, log-likelihood iteration. less common option der_iden parameter, used change one parameter time set amount. used debugging process recording intermediate values plane. option used user conjunction verbose option plot intermediate values parameter value. convergence parameters currently supported general follows: additional information parameters currently supported follows: previous options contained within list parameters, however additional standalone parameters control convergence information. follows: Going back example, code may look like following: example, parameters held constant, 100 iterations 5 half-steps used, regression performed matrix step solutions, breslow’s method tied event times used. errors unused control parameters used, simply ignored.
