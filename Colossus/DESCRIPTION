Description: Performs survival analysis using more general non-linear models. Risk models can be the sum or product of terms. Each term is the product of exponential/linear functions of covariates. Additionally subterms can be defined as a sum of exponential, linear threshold, and step functions. Either a cox proportional hazards or poisson regression are supported.
